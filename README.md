# MyMoneyManager-Backend
Backend application for MyMoneyManager. This application is a stand-alone SpringBoot application that consists of a Rest Endpoint and connects to a Database in Azure via environment variables. The sole purpose of this application is to perform CRUD operations for My Money Manager Client. I plan to implement Liquibase to keep track of database changes.
